       note: "**NOTE ON HOOD PREPARATION:** To prevent cross contamination of both the sample and other reagents, this should be carried out in the SAMPLE PREPARATION HOOD, which is pre-sterilised with UV and treated with MediPal wipes, DNAway and RNAseZap reagent. Wipe down the hood with each sequentially, allowing 5 minutes for drying between each. Pipettes should also be treated in the same way, and UV treated for 30 mins between library preparations."
       steps:
         - step: "Recommend aliquoting the Vilo mastermix, to prevent cross contamination and to reduce potential freeze/thaw cycles."
         - step: "Set up the following reaction:"
           table:
             - row: "|---|---"
             - row: "|2x Vilo Master Mix | 5&micro;L"
             - row: "|viral RNA | 5&micro;L"
             - row: "|TOTAL | 10&micro;L"
           note: "NOTE: Viral RNA input from a clinical sample should be between Ct 18-35. If Ct is between 12-15, then dilute the sample 100-fold in water, if between 15-18 then dilute 10-fold in water. This will reduce the likelihood of PCR-inhibition."

         - step: "Gently mix (avoid vortexing) then pulse spin the tube to ensure maximum contact with the thermal cycler."
         - step: "Incubate the reaction as follows:"
           table:
             - row: "|---|---|---"
             - row: "| Primer annealing | 25&deg;C | 20 mins"
