We have designed a multiplex primer scheme for Zaire Ebolavirus.

This has been tested and validated on a number of Zaire Ebolavirus isolates
(Makona, Mayinga/Ecran, and Kikwit).

The primer scheme is available from the Github repository:

https://github.com/artic-network/primer-schemes/tree/master/PanEbola/V1

It does not work with non-Zaire Ebolaviruses (e.g. Reston, Sudan)

MinION data is available here:
