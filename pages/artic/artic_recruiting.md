We are recruiting 4 postdoctoral researchers to work on the ARTIC project funded by the Wellcome Trust. 
Based in our individual research groups, these researchers will be working closely together to create a practical and integrated system for the real-time surveillance and analysis of infectious disease outbreaks.
                     
Post 1) 
: This post is based at the University of Birmingham to work as part of Nick Loman's research group focusing on [work package 3](wp3_bioinformatics) of this project. Details...

Post 2)
: Based at the [Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/evolutionary-biology) as part of [Andrew Rambaut's](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk) research group, this post will concentrate on [work package 4](wp4_phylogenetics) developing state-of-the-art methods for rapid phylodynamic analysis of real-time virus genome sequence data during outbreaks. 
The researcher will work on developing and extending our Bayesian phylogenetic package [BEAST](http://beast.community) to rapidly update key epidemiological information about the spread and evolution of the outbreak as new virus genome sequences become available. Pathogen genome sequencing is increasingly becoming an important part of outbreak response and with portable technologies such as [Nanopore sequencing](wp2-sequencing) will rapidly become routine. With the potential for such data to be produced within hours of a patient presenting, the flow of data will quickly surpass our ability to usefully analyse it using existing, computationally demanding, tools. This project requires both technical and pragmatic solutions, so that analysis can keep up with the production of genome sequence data whilst still being able to provide accurate and useful information. 

This post would suit a researcher with experience of high-performance and massively-parallel computing and Bayesian statistical inference techniques, and who wants to work as part of a large multi-disciplinary project, in particular the research groups of [Marc Suchard](http://faculty.biomath.ucla.edu/msuchard/) and [Philippe Lemey](https://www.kuleuven.be/aidslab/phylogeography/home.html) to provide tractable and scalable solutions to analysing large-scale virus genome data to inform public health response. In particular, we are looking for someone who has experience of technologies such as GPGPUs and CUDA, on-demand cloud computing platforms such as AWS, and excellent software development skills.

Post 3)
: Also part of [Andrew Rambaut's](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk) research group at the University of Edinburgh, this post will concentrate on [work package 4](wp4_phylogenetics) and [work package 5](wp5-viz-and-comms), developing methods for making epidemiological inferences from virus genome sequences collected in real-time in an emerging outbreak both at a broad-scale (inferring zoonotic origins, geographical spread and outbreak trajectory) and fine-scale (reconstructing chains of transmission to assist contact tracing and response). This work will include developing and implementing these models within a Bayesian phylogenetic framework ([BEAST](http://beast.community)) and, in collaboration with [Trevor Bedford's](http://bedford.io) and [Philippe Lemey's](https://www.kuleuven.be/aidslab/phylogeography/home.html) research groups, creating informative and interpretable visualizations to inform outbreak response.

This post would suit someone with interests and experience in infectious disease molecular epidemiology, statistical phylogenetic models of virus spread (i.e., coalescent or branching processes), and developing efficient inference techniques in a high-performance computing framework.
