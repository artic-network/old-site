We are recruiting 4 postdoctoral researchers to work on the ARTIC project funded by the Wellcome Trust. 
Based in the individual research groups, these researchers will be working closely together to create a practical and integrated system for the real-time surveillance and analysis of infectious disease outbreaks.
                     
Post 1) 
: This post is based at the University of Birmingham to work as part of Nick Loman's research group focusing on [work package 3](wp3_bioinformatics) of this project. Details...

Post 2)
: Based at the [Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/evolutionary-biology) as part of Andrew Rambaut's research group, this post will concentrate on [work package 4](wp4_phylogenetics) developing state-of-the-art methods for rapid phylodynamic analysis of real-time virus genome sequence data during outbreaks. 
The researcher will work on developing and extending our Bayesian phylogenetic package [BEAST](http://beast.community) to rapidly update key epidemiological information about the spread and evolution of the outbreak as new virus genome sequences become available.

Post 3)
: Also part of Andrew Rambaut's research group at the University of Edinburgh, this post will concentrate on [work package 4](wp4_phylogenetics) and [work package 5](wp5-viz-and-comms), developing methods for making epidemiological inferences from virus genome sequences collected in real-time in an emerging outbreak both at a broad-scale (inferring the geographical spread and outbreak trajectory) and fine-scale (reconstructing chains of transmission to assist contact tracing and response). This work will include developing and implementing these models within a Bayesian phylogenetic framework ([BEAST](http://beast.community)) and (in collaboration with Trevor Bedford's and Philippe Lemey's research groups) creating informative and interpretable visualizations to inform outbreak response.
