# Aims

{% include links.html %}

1. Generating a real-time temporal and evolutionary overview of the epidemic

We aim to develop an efficient ‘real-time’ approach that can automatically update the time-measured phylogeny as sequence data is generated. In addition to the approach implemented in [nextstrain](www.nextstrain.org/), we will explore a Bayesian inference procedure adopting the [BEAST](http://beast.community) framework that can rapidly converge to then posterior distribution of phylogenies for an expanded sequence data set.


2. Revealing geographical dispersal and mapping genetic and phenotypic changes
3. Approaches for incorporating within-host variation into phylodynamic analysis
4. Testing hypotheses of epidemiological linkages between cases
5. Evaluation of system
